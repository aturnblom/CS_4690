# WEB 3 Angular Assignment
### CS 4690

This assignment was to create a website with two different ways
to view student information, one being a table view and the other, a tile view. This project implements [angularjs], [angular-material], [express], [node] and [mongodb]. 
The project was programmed by **Charles Jones** and **Allison Turnblom** and can be seen at this [GitHub] repository.

### Highlights

1. REST Server (using Express)
2. Angular framework
3. Angular Material based styles
4. Retrieves data from mongodb

### What you should see

As you pull up the website you will see a table of basic student information. Three buttons that allow adding, deleting and updating students. And a set of icons that allow you to change your view between table and tile.
