# WEB 3 Angular Assignment

This assignment was to create a website with two different ways
to view student information. One being in a table view and the other
being a tiles view. This project implements [angular-material]. It was
coded by **Charles Jones** and **Allison Turnblom** through our [GitHub] repository.

### Highlights

1.Server using REST
2.Angular implementation
3.Material interface
3.Pulls info from file containing JSON

## What you should see

As you pull up the website you will see a table of names, addresses, id's and more.
There will be three buttons right above that, where you can add a new student, delete
a current student, or update a current student. Above those buttons you will see a
table and tiles icon that you can press to change your view.
